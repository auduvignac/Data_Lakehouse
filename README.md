# Car Price Data Preparation Pipeline

Data pipeline for car price analytics â€” ingest, curate, transform, and optimize with Delta tables.

## Creating and Managing the Virtual Environment

The project uses a Python virtual environment to isolate its dependencies.
A `setup_env.py` script is provided to automatically create and configure this environment at the root of the project.

### Steps

1. Verify that Python 3.10 (or higher) is installed:

   ```bash
   python3.10 --version
   ```

2. Create the virtual environment and install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3.10 ./setup_env.py
   ```
